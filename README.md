# python-challenge

For this challenge, we will explore two different datasets. 
The first data set will be an evaluation of Financial Records.
The second data set will evaluate the results of an Election. 

For this challenge, the below resources were used as a reference to create the script and review errors:
   Xpert Learning Assistant,
   Census Challenge from Module 3 and
   Zoom examples from Module 3.

Individual data, script, and text files are in their appropriate folders. 

Thank you!
